Let's say you have built a mernstack application, which means you have got mongodb for your database, express and nodejs for the server side and react for the frontend. Now you want to run this application on another computer or server. Traditionally you would have to install react, mongodb, nodejs, express and setup everything step by step manually. This will take a lot of time and you might make mistakes along the way. But with docker container, you don't need to go through this pain, instead you can package your entire mernstack application into a docker container. This container will have mongodb, express, nodejs and your react frontend all setup and ready to go. So when you want to deploy your application on a different device, you simply take this docker container and run it.
